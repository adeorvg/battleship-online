This project was an assignment for [Java - object-oriented programming of multimedia applications](https://usosweb.usos.pw.edu.pl/kontroler.php?_action=katalog2/przedmioty/pokazPrzedmiot&kod=103A-TLRTM-ISP-OPA) at [Warsaw University of Technology](https://www.pw.edu.pl/engpw). 

You can create your own game or join an existing one. In the project I was responsible for the backend part - matchmaking, and tracking of games' progress on the server. We planned to add some fireworks at the future, such as animations, and rankings but we ceased the development of the project.
For all of us it was one of the first Java projects.
